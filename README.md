## Tasks for exercise in class, homework for the course, and my solutions.

## About the Course
The Back-End Test Automation course provides essential skills for planning, developing, and maintaining automated test scripts focused on back-end systems. Participants will learn tools and practices for testing web services and web APIs using tools and libraries like Postman and RestSharp. They will write integration and API tests in C#, and explore basic DevOps practices such as building automated continuous integration systems (CI/CD pipelines) and working with cloud platforms like GitHub Actions. This allows for the automatic execution of automated tests with every code change in the application. The course will also cover performance testing using tools like JMeter and K6. By the end of the course, participants will have the skills to build and integrate individual automation solutions for back-end applications using C#.

### Skills You Will Acquire:
- Practical experience with RestSharp
- Practical experience with NUnit
- Skills in API and REST service testing
- Writing testing scripts with Postman
- Performance testing
- Practical experience with JMeter and K6

### Who Is This Course For?
This course is ideal for individuals with knowledge of software quality assurance (test cases, bug tracking, testing levels) and basic programming skills (working with variables, data, conditional constructs, loops, and OOP). Basic knowledge of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is required, as well as English language proficiency at level B2.
